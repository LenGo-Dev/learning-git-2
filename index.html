        <h1>Cover Me In Sunshine</h1>
        <h4>Song by Pink â€§ 2021</h4>
        <p>I've been dreaming of friendly faces
            I've got so much time to kill
            Just imagine people laughing
            I know some day we will
            And even if it's far away
            Get me through another day
        </p>
        <p>Cover me in sunshine
            Shower me with good times
            Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
            And everything will be alright
            Cover me in sunshine
        </p>
        <p>From a distance all these mountains
            Are just some tiny hills
            Wildflowers, they keep living
            While they're just standing still
            I've been missing yesterday
            But what if there's a better place?
        </p>
        <p>Cover me in sunshine
            Shower me with good times
            Tell me that the world's been spinning since the beginning
            And everything will be alright
        </p>
