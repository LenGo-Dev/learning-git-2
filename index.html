                    <h4>Song by Pink â€§ 2021</h4>
                    <p>I've been dreaming of friendly faces
                       <br> I've got so much time to kill
                        <br>Just imagine people laughing
                        <br> I know some day we will
                        <br> And even if it's far away
                        <br> Get me through another day
                    </p>
                    <p>Cover me in sunshine
                        <br>Shower me with good times
                        <br>Tell me that the world's been
                        <br>spinning since the beginning
                        <br>And everything will be alright
                        <br> Cover me in sunshine
                    </p>
                    <p>From a distance all these mountains
                        <br>Are just some tiny hills
                        <br> Wildflowers, they keep living
                        <br>While they're just standing still
                        <br>I've been missing yesterday
                        <br>But what if there's a better place?
                    </p>
                    <p>Cover me in sunshine
                        <br>Shower me with good times
                        <br>Tell me that the world's been
                        <br>spinning since the beginning
                        <br>And everything will be alright
                    </p>
